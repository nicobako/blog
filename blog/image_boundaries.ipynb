    "# Boundary Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This post extends concepts discussed in [a previous post about pixels as vectors](images).\n",
    "You don't *need* to read that one first.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of tools available for performing image processing,\n",
    "but let's say that we want to implement our own *boundary detection* algorithm.\n",
    "How would you go about that?\n",
    "Here is my completely naive attempt at trying to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I'm not an image processing wizard, but my guess is that you would\n",
    "somehow need to compare pixel value(s) to their neighbour(s).\n",
    "A simple solution could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If pixel values are similar enough, then the pixels might belong to the same object.\n",
    "* If pixel values are not similar enough, then they belong to different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems simple enough, but in order to really\n",
    "solve this problem we will need to specify a few more things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do we determine *neighbors* of pixels?\n",
    "* What is our method for *comparing* pixel values?\n",
    "* How do we determine if pixels are *similar*?\n",
    "* What constitutes an *object*?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding Neighbouring Pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a simple approach of just itereating over the rows and columns\n",
    "of our images. Pixels are adjacent to eachother if they are in the same\n",
    "row/column and if they are adjacent each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing Pixel Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine if we treat all the pixels in an image as vectors.\n",
    "Vectors have both _magnitude_ and _direction_.\n",
    "The [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)\n",
    "is a mathematical operation that returns the angle between two unit vectors.\n",
    "Could we use this simple measurement as a means for comparing pixel values?\n",
    "Another metric that we could use is the magnitude of a vector.\n",
    "We could probably use this metric as well to compare the brightness\n",
    "of two pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threshold \n",
    "\n",
    "The *dot product* of two vectors returns a single value (i.e. a *float*).\n",
    "The dot product is a special number in that it returns the angle between\n",
    "two vectors.\n",
    "Could our logic be as simple as computing the dot product of two pixels,\n",
    "and it is below some threshold, then we can assume the pixels belong to the same object?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Constitutes an Object\n",
    "\n",
    "We are representing an object as a collection of pixels, right?\n",
    "If multiple pixels are connected, that's an object.\n",
    "So, lone pixels not connected to any other pixels are not objects.\n",
    "Moreover, we may want to also specify\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing Connected Pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use one of my favourite techniques: [graph processing with networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html)!\n",
    "We will use *networkx* to connect neighboring pixels.\n",
    "If we determine that pixels belong to the same object\n",
    "then we create a connection between the pixels."
