    "# Autodocumenting Pydantic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a shout-out to [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).\n",
    "*pydantic* is a wonderful tool that I find myself using quite often!\n",
    "Honestly, I probably use it too much... but who cares! I love *pydantic*!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do I mean by *autodocumenting*\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea originated from [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/638).\n",
    "Esentially, the idea is that, since the *pydantic* model already\n",
    "knows a lot of information about itself (such as the field types, descriptions, etc.),\n",
    "then why can't a model's `__doc__` string be created automatically by `pydantic`?\n",
    "Sounds like a reasonable thing, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many reasons why it wouldn't be wise to make this part of *pydantic*.\n",
    "First of all, generating a *docstring* could be really expensive,\n",
    "and will decrease performance. Secondly, there are so many different ways\n",
    "to add documentation to a Python class (e.g. numpy-style, google-style, rst-style, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this is what I mean by *autodocumenting pydantic models*:\n",
    "automatically setting the `__doc__` string of *pydantic models*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some existing solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial wouldn't be complete without first acknoweldging that there\n",
    "are existing tools that can generate documentation for *pydantic* models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most notable of all is [autodoc_pydantic](https://github.com/mansenfranzen/autodoc_pydantic).\n",
    "This tool won't modify a *pydantic* model's `__doc__` string,\n",
    "but it wil arguably do more... it wiL generate really beautiful [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/contents.html)\n",
    "documentation for your *pydantic* classes!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you are already using *Sphinx* for documentation,\n",
    "then please consider using *autodoc_pydantic* instead of following the advice\n",
    "in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will show you the basics of how to make autodocumenting your \n",
    "*pydantic* models possible, and will give you the tools you need to \n",
    "customize the look and feel of your models' `__doc__` strings.\n",
    "The approach I demonstrate is taken from\n",

    "to effect all of our models, we will follow the advice given by *pydantic*\n",
    "on [how to change behaviour of models globally](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/model_config/#change-behaviour-globally).\n",
