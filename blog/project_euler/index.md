# Project Euler

In this chapter I'll try to solve some problems from
[projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/).
In case you've never heard of this website,
it contains a large number of math/programming puzzles.

My main goal in this chapter is to try to solve these puzzles
using Python. I will try to explain myself as I solve the puzzles, and will try to be honest about mistakes and
faulty logic. I'm not trying to just *show answers to problems*. Rather, I'm trying to show *how* I solved - or didn't solve - the problems.
