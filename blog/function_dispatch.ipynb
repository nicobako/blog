    "The most important thing is the strong type system.\n",

    "I particularly miss how easy it was to overload functions.\n",
    "Functions can be overloaded based on the types of the arguments, even the number of arguments!\n",

    "\n",
    "With a little creativity, we can get Python to do the same thing!\n",
    "Actually, we can get Python to do even more!\n",
