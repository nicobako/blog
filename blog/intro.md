# Welcome to Nico's Blog

Hello, World! My name is [Nico Bakomihalis](about_the_author.md),
and this is my blog.

As a self-diagnosed perfectionist,
I often struggle with finding the right balance between writing
*perfect* code, and writing code that is *good enough*.
Sometimes my *perfectionism* leads to awesome code,
but more than often it does not.
The main purpose of this blog is to showcase
some of the cool things you can do with Python
while still striving to write code of *good*, but not *perfect* Python.
I may, from time to time, dive into some topics that are
aimed at being a *better software developer*.

```{note}
This is not intended to be an *introduction to Python*.
Instead, it assumes you already have a decent understanding of the language.
