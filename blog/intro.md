# Welcome to Nico's Blog

Hello, World! My name is [Nico Bakomihalis](about_the_author.md),
and this is [my blog](about_this_blog.md).

As a self-diagnosed perfectionist,
I often struggle with finding the right balance between writing
*perfect* code and writing *good* code.
Sometimes my *perfectionism* leads to awesome code...
but usually it does not. Over the years I've learnt that perfection isn't merely elusive; perfection is impossible.

The main purpose of this blog is to showcase
some of the cool things you can do with Python
while still striving to write *good* - not *perfect* - Python.
