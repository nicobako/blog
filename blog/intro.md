# Welcome to Nico's Blog

Hello, World! My name is [Nico Bakomihalis](about_the_author.md),
and this is [my blog](about_this_blog.md).

Finding a balance between writing *good* code and writing
*perfect* code is a challenge in and of itself.
Sometimes my *perfectionism* leads to awesome code,
but usually it does not.
Over the years I've learnt that *good* is better than *perfect*.

My main goal, in writing this blog,
is to *throw good code* at *interesting problems*,
and see what sticks.
I usually know very little about the topics I am writing about,
but I have fun figuring things out one line of good code at a time.
