Perfectionist Python
====================

Hello, world!

My name is Nico Bakomihalis.
As a self-diagnosed perfectionist,
I often struggle with finding a balance between writing
*perfect* and *good* code. This site will be all about
writing *good Python* - whatever that means.

.. note::

   This site is still under construction,
   and I will be adding content in the near future.
